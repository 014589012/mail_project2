# mail_project2
Data available at https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/.

Solution code assumes root directory **maildir** to be in the current working directory.

If data is stored elsewhere, path needs to be updated in the code.

The code writes two csv files to answer the following tasks:

**1.** calculate how many emails were sent from each sender address to each recipient,

**2.** calculate the average number of emails received per day per employee per day of week (monday, tuesday, etc.).
